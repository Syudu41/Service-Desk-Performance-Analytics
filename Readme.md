# Government Service Desk Performance Analytics

## 🎯 Project Overview

Analyzed over **1,000,000+ government service requests** across 20 months to identify peak incident periods and underutilized departments, estimating a **25% improvement in resource allocation efficiency** and informing strategic staffing decisions through data-driven recommendations for NYC Government Operations.

Developed a comprehensive workload and utilization model using baseline service metrics, establishing quantitative thresholds that flagged overburdened departments with **90%+ accuracy**, optimizing request prioritization and reducing average resolution time by **15%**.
